# company_text_based_simulator
This is a text based game where you just can create and manage your company to become the best company ever. Game will have many features that will make it more interesting to
people and enjoyable...

## WHY TEXT BASED GAME.. WHEN YOU CAN JUST USE GRAPHICS
This is intended for skill development.. Some may think it's lame to have text based and even be like "dude text based games are old stuff", but as i've said, just have to start small. This project can continue once the text based part is finished. 
That will be like having a full functional game but just played with commands.

### WHAT I WOULD APPRECIATE
Getting more contributions as it's just me, myself and I.
